# Skill_demonstration

This skill demonstration page will illustrates some key skill-sets for a Data Scientist/Business Analytst via several projects.

It includes scases written in Python that able to handle practical questions and tasks.
     
  1. Data preprocessing: Python script to preprocess a set of meeting transcripts and convert them into numerical representations
  suitable for input into topic segmentation algorithms.
  
  2. Data Cleansing: Python script to audit and clean a data set with common problems, such as:
      - Typos and spelling mistakes 
      - Irregularities
      - Violations of the Integrity constraint
      - Duplications
      - Missing values
    
  3. Data Streaming: Using Kafka, Spark and MongoDB to process, store and visualise the streaming data.
  
  4. Link Prediction: Prediciting pairwise relationship in an academic co-authorship graph. In short, using existing graph characteristics (degree, distance) to predict furture linkage when given some new authors' information.
  
  5. Assortment Management: Using customer purchase data to fit a Mixed Multinomial Logit model, then use this model to build an optimal assortment from the full production list, in order to maximise the overall revenue of selling the assortment.
