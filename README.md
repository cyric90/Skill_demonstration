# Skill_demonstration

This skill demonstration page will illustrates some key skill-sets for a Data Scientist/Business Analytst via several projects.

It includes scases written in Python that able to handle practical questions and tasks.
  
| Project Nmae  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| [1. Data preprocessing](https://github.com/cyric90/Skill_demonstration/tree/master/Python/Text%20preprocessing)  | Preprocessing a set of job ad description using NPL framework and converting them into numerical representations suitable for further segmentation analysis.  |
| [2. Data Cleansing](https://github.com/cyric90/Skill_demonstration/tree/master/Python/Data%20cleansing) | Auditing and cleansing a data set with common problems, such as: 1.Typos and spelling mistake. 2.Irregularities 3.Violations of the Integrity constraint. 4.Duplications. 5.Missing values |
| [3. Data Streaming](https://github.com/cyric90/Skill_demonstration/tree/master/Python/Spark_Kafka)  | Using Kafka, Spark and MongoDB to process, store and visualise the streaming data.  |
| [4. Link Prediction](https://github.com/cyric90/Skill_demonstration/tree/master/Link_prediction) | Prediciting pairwise relationship in an academic co-authorship graph. Using existing graph characteristics (degree, distance) to predict furture linkage when given new authors' information.  |
|  [5. Assortment Management](https://github.com/cyric90/Skill_demonstration/tree/master/Assortment_optimisation)  | Using customer purchase data to fit a Mixed Multinomial Logit model, then using this model to build an optimal assortment from the full production list, in order to maximise the overall revenue of selling the assortment.  |
